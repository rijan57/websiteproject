question: What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
ans: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer 
protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.

question: Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?
ans: HTTP is called as a stateless protocol because each request is executed independently,
 without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it, which means once 
the transaction ends the connection between the browser and the server is also lost.

question: Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP
Ans: In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:

The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).
The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.
The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.

question: Describe the parameters on a get and post request.
ans: 

question:What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?
ans: 200 indicates The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method:
GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
HEAD: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.
PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.

The HTTP 404 Not Found client error response code indicates that the server 
can't find the requested resource.  

question: What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.
ans:An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends 
to the user's web browser. 
The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server.
example:/docs., /docs/Web/ ,/docs/Web/HTTP etc.

question: Why are cookies a security issue?
ans: Since the data in cookies doesn't change, cookies themselves aren't harmful. 
They can't infect computers with viruses or other malware.
 However, some cyberattacks can hijack cookies and enable access to your browsing sessions. 
 The danger lies in their ability to track individuals' browsing histories.

question: Describe session hijacking and XSS
Ans: Cross-site scripting (XSS): This is probably the most dangerous and widespread method of web 
session hijacking. ... If the server doesn't set the HttpOnly attribute in session cookies, 
injected scripts can gain access to your session key, providing attackers with the necessary 
information for session hijacking.

question: Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)
ans: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions 
on a web application in which they're currently authenticated 
If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

question: What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?
ans: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a 
server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from
 which a browser should permit loading of resources.
 Simple requests:
GET.
HEAD.
POST.
